                        liability of the policyholder in case of damage to the Car is limited to the amount of the
                        corresponding excess, except in cases where the policyholder intentionally causes damage or is
                        under the influence of alcohol or drugs or improper use of the Car (including, but not limited
                        to, leaving the main roads or allowing a third person to drive the rented car to a person
                        without permission). This "refusal" does not eliminate the franchise completely, but only
                        reduces it. Collision damage insurance covers most of the car, but usually excludes the chassis,
                        roof, tires, windshield, windows, interior, replacement keys, side mirrors, and towing costs);

                        amount of the corresponding excess, unless the losses were caused by the negligence of the

                        5.5 You should carefully study the terms and conditions provided by the Operator. You should
                        also carefully consider the Operator and, if necessary, ask questions about the exclusions
                        applicable to the above policies, as exclusions may vary from insurer to insurer and from policy
                        to policy. It is not unusual to exclude from third-party liability insurance your family members
                        or people living at your home address, and therefore they are not insured. Additional insurance
                        policies can usually be purchased from car rental service providers; Such policies may already
                        be included in your vacation insurance package, if you have one. Thus, you should familiarize
                        yourself with the full scope of insurance coverage provided by the Operator and, if necessary,
                        take out any additional insurance policy.

                        17.1 All technical problems or accidents related to the vehicle must be reported to the Operator
                        immediately. In case of accidents, it is also imperative to notify the local police and obtain a
                        signed police report. It is necessary to collect all possible data about any third parties
                        involved in the incident. You are not allowed to repair or replace the vehicle without the prior
                        written consent of the Operator. Copies of all documents must be kept throughout the rental
                        period in case of need for the intervention of the insurance company. Please note that
                        compensation may be rejected if this procedure has not been properly followed.
